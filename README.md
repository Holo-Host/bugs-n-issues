# bugs-n-issues

Private repo serving as a bugs and issues database.

An intention here is to create space for recording and discussing Holo Network related issues. That way it is easier to track and decide on importance of a fix or improvement.

Please file under github issues. Try to give as detailed description as possible, including for example:
- Description of a current state and what IYO should be improved
- Way to reproduce flawed behavior and where to observe it
- Logs showing an error
- Pointer to lines of code responsible for misbehavior

Giving proposal for a solution is encouraged in a comments section of an issue.

Use of tags with names of a component is welcome (i.e. `envoy`, `configure-holochain` etc).
